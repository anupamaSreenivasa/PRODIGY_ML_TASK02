_**Project Overview**_
**Objective**
  The main objective of this task is to develop a K-means clustering algorithm to analyze customer purchase behavior and group them into different clusters.
  This grouping will help the retail store understand customer segments and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

**Project Structure**
  Data Preprocessing: Preparing and cleaning the customer purchase history data.
  K-means Clustering Implementation: Applying the K-means clustering algorithm to the preprocessed data.
  Evaluation and Visualization: Assessing the quality of the clustering and visualizing the results.
**Key Features**
  Data Loading: Load and explore the customer purchase history dataset.
  Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize the data.
  Clustering: Implement the K-means algorithm to group customers into clusters.
  Visualization: Visualize the clusters using 2D and 3D plots for better understanding.
**Results**
  The K-means algorithm clusters customers based on their purchase history. The results are visualized in both 2D and 3D plots, showing how customers are grouped into distinct segments.
  These visualizations help in identifying patterns and making data-driven decisions for marketing and sales strategies.
